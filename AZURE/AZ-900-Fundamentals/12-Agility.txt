Agility, when it comes to cloud computing,
relates to both the business and the computing context.

In the cloud computing context,
agility often refers to the ability
to rapidly develop, test, and launch
software applications that drive business growth.

Cloud agility allows businesses
to focus on other issues,
such as security, monitoring, and analysis,
instead of provisioning and maintaining the resources.
