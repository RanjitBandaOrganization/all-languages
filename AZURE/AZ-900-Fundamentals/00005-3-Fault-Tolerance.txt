-As with high availability, fault tolerance is a term that's used to describe the resilience(the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness) of cloud computing.
-----Where high availability doesn't guarantee zero downtime,a fault tolerance system does.
-------As the name implies, the cloud system is tolerant to any faults that may occur.
-------Tolerant meaning that any fault in the system that causes Azure services to fail are mitigated and dealt with by Azure itself.
