Disaster recovery means having a plan
to recover a complete system
in the event of a major disaster,
like a tornado or flood.
This is done using time-to-recovery
and recovery point metrics.

-In the same vein as high availability and fault tolerance
is the term disaster recovery.
----While high availability and fault tolerance will deal with Azure outages,
----what happens in the event of a catastrophic disaster (such as a hurricane, flood, or tornado), a cyber attack, or something else of that magnitude?

-----Disaster recovery consists of complete plans to recover critical business systems and normal operations if such an event occurs.
------Disaster recovery is configured with a designated time-to-recovery and recovery point, which represents the time it takes to restore essential systems and the point in time before the disaster which is restored.
